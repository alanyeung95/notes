### What is bias?

Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to high error on training and test data.

### How do we fix high bias?

High bias is due to a simple model and we also see a high training error. To fix that we can do following things

- Add more input features
- Add more complexity by introducing polynomial features
- Decrease Regularization term

### What is variance?

Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasnâ€™t seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data.

### How do we fix high variance?

High variance is due to a model that tries to fit most of the training dataset points and hence gets more complex. To resolve high variance issue we need to work on

- Getting more training data
- Reduce input features
- Increase Regularization term
