## Mu Symbol (μ) 
it represents the population mean

## Population Standard Deviation
The population standard deviation is a measure of the spread (variability) of the scores on a given variable and is represented by:
```
σ = sqrt[ Σ ( Xi – μ )2 / N ]
```

## Population Variance
The population variance is the square of the population standard deviation and is represented by:
```
σ2 = Σ ( Xi – μ )2 / N
```
The symbol ‘σ2’ represents the population variance.

## `|u|`
norm, magnitude (or length) of u vector
or 
```
√a^2+b^2
∣r∣=√r⋅r
```
