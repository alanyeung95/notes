# Lecture-1: Project management fundamentals

## routine work vs project work
### routine work (support work)
answering questions, going to regularly scheduled meeting

### project work
a project is a temporary activity with a starting date, specific goals and condition, defined responsibilities, a budget, a fixed end date and multiple parties involved. For example, wedding.

#### goal
project's goal must produce something tangible and add value to the organization

## The Four constraints of Project
1. Scope constraint (what is the project trying to accomplish?)
3. Time constraint (how long should it take to complete?)
4. Cost constraint (what should it cost?)
5. Quality constraint (what defect level?)

normally we can only have 3 of the 4

## generic project life cycle
define project goal > plan project > execute project plan > close project > evaluate project

## system development life cycle (inside executre project plan)
planning > analysis > design > implementation > maintenance & support
